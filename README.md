i have autism. even if we are friends &/or have spoken before, i'll probably be really awkward and nervous. my social skills are awful.. please excuse me if i go silent randomly.
(i can also be really really loud and obnoxious LOL so sorry about that ...)

if we've talked before, feel free to friend me <3
